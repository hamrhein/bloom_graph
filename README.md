Jupyter notebook showing bloom graph creation, 15 August 2017

***Henry Amrhein - California Institute of Technology, Biology and Biological Engineering***

## Description

A bloom graph is used to represent clusters of genes, where a cluster is
represented by a central node whose neighbors are members of the cluster.
The central node size is determined by the cluster size.  Edge thickness
represents log10 cluster confidence in the input matrix.  Nodes can belong
to two or more clusters.

## Requirements
